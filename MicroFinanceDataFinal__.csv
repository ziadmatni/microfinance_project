These small loans, used to start or expand businesses and generate earnings, were a proven path out of poverty for thousands around the world. But microfinance institutions were always set up as not-for-profits, so their ability to help was limited by the grants and donations they received. Vikram wasn't the first person to bring microfinance to India, but his idea was to do it at a previously unheard-of scale, for millions rather than thousands. He would do this by making SKS Microfinance a for-profit institution, capable of raising funds and growing as fast as profits allowed. SKS flourished, distributing billions of dollars of loans and becoming one of the world's most successful microfinance institutions. But just as he thought he was really making a difference, a storm was brewing. For decades, microfinance was heralded as a key solution to global poverty, and nearly overnight, it came to be viewed instead as a villain. In the blink of an eye, the company's stellar reputation had vanished. Faced with extortion and murder threats, everything Akula had worked for was up in flames. This book is the story of SKS tremendous success, the oversights that led to disaster, the eventual resurgence, and the lessons learned.

Socially conscious businesses have the potential to transform societies, but there are risks as well as benefits.

Aid agencies have provided microcredits to turn the Nebajenses into entrepreneurs, but credit alone cannot boost productivity in crowded mountain valleys, which is why many recipients have invested the loans in smuggling themselves to the United States. Back home, their remittances have inflated the price of land so high that only migrants can afford to buy it. Thus, more Nebajenses have felt obliged to borrow the large sums needed to go north. So many have done so that, even before the Great Recession hit the U.S. in 2008, many were unable to find enough work to pay back their loans, triggering a financial crash back home. Now migrants and their families are losing the land and homes they have pledged as collateral.

This book analyzes the law and economics theories on access to credit and enterprise finance and based on case studies in Uganda, presents empirical findings of the promise and limits of contractual innovations in micro credit.",1, ,CS,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2010,    4.00,9

Making this dream of goodness a reality is often thwarted by thoughts surrounding sustainability. Thus, all good initiatives require a focus on sustainability and this has become one of greatest and most formidable challenges faced by any social enterprise. The book documents the understanding of the sustainability of one of the most celebrated forms of social enterprise of our times ― Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) gained through a mixed-methods research investigation. It attempts to answer pertinent questions such as: What are the determinant and discriminating factors for the sustainability of MFIs in India? How are these factors being managed by the operationally efficient Indian MFIs that remained sustainable at reasonable interest rates before the onset of the crisis and ceilings imposition in Indian microfinance markets? What does the Indian microfinance crisis teach us about sustainability management and mismanagement? In a nutshell, the answers show that sustainability is a strategic issue that needs managerial attention and not a matter to be left to serendipity. At a time when the industry is recovering from the adverse effects of a crisis and when there are still contentions as to whether the rate fixed by the regulator is enough for the sustenance of the MFIs, the findings mentioned in the book revive the lost hope for the Indian microfinance industry. By deciphering the strategies used by efficient and sustainable MFIs and discussing the lessons that the crisis has imparted to the Indian microfinance markets, this book will enable Indian MFIs to march towards efficient and sustainable operations without losing focus on their clients.",1, ,RE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1, ,0,2014,    3.00,6

In its unique ability to link the existing extensive network of India’s rural bank branches with the Self Help Groups (SHG), the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has covered up to 97 million poor households by March 2010 under its Self Help Group Bank Linkage Programme. Policy-makers have proclaimed SHGs as ‘‘the most potent initiative … for delivering financial services to the poor in a sustainable manner.""  This book presents a comprehensive scientific assessment of the impact of the Self Help Group Bank Linkage Programme (SBLP) on the member households. The book discusses wide-ranging topics, including the rural financial sector in India, the history and structure of the SBLP, the impact methodologies, the economic and social impact of microfinance, its role in building assets while reducing poverty and vulnerability, the role of women and their empowerment, training and accumulation of human capital and policy implications of lessons learned.  The empirical results show that vulnerability of the more mature SHG members declines significantly. Vulnerability also falls for villages with better infrastructure and for SHGs that are formed by NGOs and linked by banks. The results strongly demonstrate that on average, there is a significant increase in the empowerment of the female participants. The economic impact of SBLP is found to be the most empowering. Greater autonomy and changes in social attitudes also lead to female empowerment. The investigation further reveals that training (especially business training) has a definite positive impact on assets but not on income. The impact of training can be improved through better infrastructure (as in paved roads), linkage model type, and the training organiser.  Bridging the gap in the existing literature and between academics and practitioners, this book moves beyond the usual theoretical issues in the impact assessment literature and draws on new developments in methodology.

Microcredit has been seen in recent decades as having great potential for aiding development in poor developing countries, with Bangladesh being one of the countries which has pioneered microcredit and implemented it most widely. This book, based on extensive original research, explores how microcredit works in practice, and assesses its effectiveness. It discusses how microcredit, usually channelled through women, is often passed to the men of the family, a practice disapproved of by some, but regarded as acceptable by borrowers who have a communal approach to debt, rather than viewing debt as something held by single individuals. The book demonstrates how the rules around microcredit are often seem as irksome by the borrowers, how lenders often charge high rates of interest and work primarily to preserve their institutions, thereby going against the spirit of the microcredit movement, and how borrowers often end up on a downward spiral, deeper and deeper in debt. Overall, the book argues that although microcredit does much good, it also has many drawbacks.",1, ,CS,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2015,    2.00,4

Widely portrayed as a ""cure-all"" for poverty, the group-lending micro-credit model has received much attention as a development strategy. This book introduces the basic structure of Grameen Bank's group-lending model through an examination of its general tenets, eligibility requirements, and services offered. In understanding this methodology, the author turns to adjustments made by Grameen's international replications. The study concentrates on the Kashf Foundation, one of the most successful micro-credit institutions in Pakistan, and both the environmental differences as well as the consequent institutional changes in the replication process. After elucidating the particularities of each model, the concepts of ""success"" and ""empowerment"" are critically examined to understand the aims of different replicating models.

First, put a negligible amount of money into exactly the right hands. Then, step back. A vibrant and rapidly expanding national economy needs an active small business sector, but small entrepreneurs need loans to expand their businesses. Microfinance also has potential to be an engine of economic growth, although this prospect has been overshadowed by its image as a tool for alleviating poverty.  In Banking on Small Business, Gail Buyske analyzes three themes in economic development: the global growth of microfinance, banking sector development, and Russian entrepreneurship. These three themes intersect at KMB, the Russian Small Business Bank, where Buyske chaired the board of directors for six years. This book is in part an account of KMB's role in initiating great changes through a series of apparently small actions.  In reviewing Russian entrepreneurship and banking since the advent of perestroika in the mid-1990s, Buyske stresses that Russian entrepreneurship is more dynamic than usually perceived and that the historic lack of small-business and start-up finance was largely owing to the practices of the Russian banking sector rather than to any failing on the part of Russian entrepreneurs. Buyske's conclusions have important implications for policy worldwide; she is confident that a broad understanding of microfinance as a profitable, rather than a charitable, endeavor will contribute to the commercial involvement needed to maximize global microfinance growth.",1, ,CS,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2007,    4.00,9

Microfinance institutions of four types have emerged to meet the unfulfilled financing needs of micro-entrepreneurs: commercial banks, specialized NGO-type microfinance institutions, membership-based institutions (such as rural cooperatives and credits unions), and public funds.

The study's scope is limited to social assistance and poverty-targeted programs, of which there are two kinds: programs with and without work requirements. Chapter 2 outlines the issues pertaining to targeting and the accompanying trade-offs between cost and efficiency. Chapter 3, 4, and 5 discuss country experience with cash transfers, in-kind transfers, and income-generation programs. Three common issues are: how successfully the program reached the poor, how cost-effectively they reached the poor, and whether or not the programs were able to avoid adverse incentive for work, labor supply and private saving. Chapter 6 evaluates the design issues and delivery mechanisms generic to all programs, and develop a fourfold typology of program delivery. This chapter also examines how social funds generate different outcomes depending on which delivery mechanism is chosen.

His dream is the total eradication of poverty from the world. In 1983, against the advice of banking and government officials, Yunus established Grameen, a bank devoted to providing the poorest of Bangladesh with minuscule loans. Grameen Bank, based on the belief that credit is a basic human right, not the privilege of a fortunate few, now provides over 2.5 billion dollars of micro-loans to more than two million families in rural Bangladesh. Ninety-four percent of Yunus's clients are women, and repayment rates are near 100 percent. Around the world, micro-lending programs inspired by Grameen are blossoming, with more than three hundred programs established in the United States alone.  Banker to the Poor is Muhammad Yunus's memoir of how he decided to change his life in order to help the world's poor.

Nearly forty percent of humanity lives on an average of two dollars a day or less. If you've never had to survive on an income so small, it is hard to imagine. How would you put food on the table, afford a home, and educate your children? How would you handle emergencies and old age? Every day, more than a billion people around the world must answer these questions. Portfolios of the Poor is the first book to systematically explain how the poor find solutions to their everyday financial problems.


The authors conducted year-long interviews with impoverished villagers and slum dwellers in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa--records that track penny by penny how specific households manage their money. The stories of these families are often surprising and inspiring. Most poor households do not live hand to mouth, spending what they earn in a desperate bid to keep afloat. Instead, they employ financial tools, many linked to informal networks and family ties. They push money into savings for reserves, squeeze money out of creditors whenever possible, run sophisticated savings clubs, and use microfinancing wherever available. Their experiences reveal new methods to fight poverty and ways to envision the next generation of banks for the ""bottom billion.""

The combined weight of American diplomacy and military power cannot end unrest and extremism in the Middle East and other troubled regions of the world, Steven Koltai argues.

From 9/11 and the Arab Spring to the self-proclaimed Islamic caliphate, instability and terror breed where young men cannot find jobs. Koltai marshals evidence to show that joblessness - not religious or cultural conflict - is the root cause of the unrest that vexes American foreign policy and threatens international security. Drawing on Koltai's stint as Senior Adviser for Entrepreneurship in Secretary Hillary Clinton's State Department, and his thirty-year career as a successful entrepreneur and business executive, World Peace through Entrepreneurship argues for the significant elevation of entrepreneurship in the service of foreign policy. This entrepreneurship is not rural microfinance or mercantile trading. It is the scalable stuff of Silicon Valley and Sam Walton, generating the vast majority of new jobs in economies large and small. World Peace through Entrepreneurship offers a nonmilitary, long-term solution at a time of disillusionment with Washington's ""big development"" approach to unstable and underdeveloped parts of the world - and when the new normal is fear of terrorist attacks against Western targets, beheadings in Syria, and jihad.

The author thoroughly reviews aid for trade, regional integration and microfinance and a host of other solutions that have been proposed - arguing that an exit strategy for both donors and the least developed countries will have to consider the optimal combination of these specific initiatives to best satisfy the necessity of development and at the same time solve the problems of conventional aid.""--Publisher's website", ,?,M,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2012,    4.00,10

Opening its account at the dawn of the colonial era, Fiery Dragons tells the story of Burma's financial system – of its banks, moneylenders and 'microfinanciers' – through to the present day, to the events that in our times bring the Burmese people out into their streets to demand something better. It argues that Burma's financial system matters, and that the careful study of this system can tell us much about Burma (and something about other developing countries, too). While financial systems and institutions matter in all countries, the book argues that they especially count in Burma. Events in the financial and monetary sphere have been unusually – spectacularly – prominent in Burma's turbulent modern history. From the Chettiars and the alienation of the land to the backlash against the foreign moneylender. From the great state banks of the democracy years to the Orwellian 'people's banks' of the Burma way to socialism. From Burma's bizarre demonetization experiences to the rise and crash of the entrepreneurial bankers. And from the money launderers to the practitioners of microfinance. The story of Burma's financial system and its players is one that has shaped the country.

Micro-finance has been holding the interest of researchers, scholars and practitioners for some time now because of its development implications and impact on women empowerment. Women micro-entrepreneurs in addition to facing serious bottlenecks like male domination and social taboos also suffer from dearth of capital to finance their economic activities. Micro-finance as a major development strategy provides a practical approach to attack the vices of poverty, especially for women. The book deals with - Concepts of micro-finance, systems of micro-finance delivery, i.e., the savings and credit linkages of Self Help Groups with banks, different likage models. - Activities of institutions like the NABARD and SIDBI in linking groups and the features of the SGSY launched by the Government. - The role played by a regional Rural Bank in North Bengal in formation and linking of SHGs. - The perception of women micro-entrepreneurs towards micro-financing schemes and SHGs, their activities in SHGs, their problems and constraints in dealing with banks and role and perception of bank officials. - Impact of micro-finance schemes on women using socio-economic indicators. - Policy implications for better administration of Micro-finance schemes.

Access to finance continues to remain one of the key constraints faced by SMEs to start and expand businesses, particularly in the developing economies where access to bank loans is subject to the availability of collateral. The SME financing gap, studied from the perspectives of both the key actors - banks and SMEs - is well presented in this book. The authors have used Sequential Explanatory Design, a mixed methodology, to collect data from SMEs and banks. The econometric model of the study represented SMEs' debt accessibility as a function of independent variables of loan repayment capacity, financial information, characteristics of the firm and owner and bank loan characteristics. The book provides empirical evidence that SME financing constraints are caused by factors arising from SMEs as well as the banks, primarily SMEs' high information opacity and banks' imposition of collateral to offset the credit risk. In the estimation of the econometric model, the size of collateral and owner's equity were among the most significant predictor variables. Likewise, the thematic analysis of interview data of credit officers to understand the banks' lending behavior evidenced a strong positive relationship between the size of the collateral and owner's equity and access to bank loans. SMEs' high information opacity and credit risk induced adverse selection and credit rationing on the part of finance providers. The findings of this book contribute towards academic literature on developing economies characterized by limited data available for academic and empirical research. This book provides a unique example of rigorous research on SME finance within an information economics framework. The theoretical issues are nicely balanced by the practical application of information economics to an emerging market. It can be used as a reference by researchers, academics, practitioners and policy makers in the areas of development finance, banking, development economics, microfinance and rural development. In addition, it can be used as an academic reference for a finance subject at the Master's or Doctoral level.

Money defines our present and will shape our future. Every investment decision we make adds a chapter to the story of what our world will look like. Although the idea of mission-based finance has been around for decades, there is a gap between organizations' stated intention to ""do good"" and meaningful impact. Still, some are succeeding. In Just Money, Katrin Kaufer and Lillian Steponaitis take readers on a global tour of financial institutions that use finance as a force for good. Kaufer and Steponaitis visit a bank in Europe that bases its business model on full transparency; a credit union in Canada that designed an alternative to payday lending for its community; and microfinance institutions in El Salvador and Bangladesh that provide financing to small-business clients who do not have access to the mainstream banking system. They discuss what it takes to build and operate a mission-focused business, whether the Just Banking model is scalable in the face of systemic barriers, and how to assess impact effectively. Finally, they introduce the logic of ecosystem finance, in which business decisions align with societal needs. Doing so requires more than adding impact indicators; it requires developing a new business model. With Just Money, Kaufer and Steponaitis remind us that money, if used intentionally and equitably, can be just money-a tool that serves nature, human development, and social justice.

Philanthropist and self-made millionaire Phil Smith and microcredit expert and consultant Eric Thurman provide a riveting narrative that explores how these small loans, arranged by “barefoot bankers,” enable impoverished people to start small businesses, support their families, and improve local economies. By paying back their loans instead of simply accepting handouts, men and women around the world are continually giving others the same opportunity to change their futures.  Smith and Thurman also examine why traditional charity programs, while providing short-term relief, often perpetuate the problems they are trying to alleviate, and how applying investment principles to philanthropy is the key to reversing poverty permanently.

Islamic capital markets, and Islamic finance in general, is experiencing global rapid growth and is currently receiving more consideration also by non-Islamic investors. Islamic Finance is based on the prohibition of interest (""Riba""), excessive uncertaintly (""Gharar"") and gambling (""Maysir"" or ""Qimar""). From these foundations, conventional financial products, such as interest-bearing instruments, options, forwards, futures, and insurances, as well as conventional practices like short-selling and leveraging, are not compliant with Islamic law (""Shariah""). Nevertheless, the Islamic finance industry has undertaken considerable efforts to create products and solutions of the same value, in many instances by replicating conventional structures in a Shariah-compliant manner. This has led to discussions between scholars and practitioners, as some scholars regard specific replication techniques merely as ploys and ruses. While no definite answer can be given yet concerning the question of Shariah-compliance for every single instrument, some trends are emerging in this dynamic market. Islamic derivative products are essential for asset management and risk management in any Islamic context, and provide answers to many of the investors' needs. This book covers all Islamic derivatives and structured products including state of the art Islamic short-selling methods used by hedge funds and gives a comprehensive overview of current Islamic capital markets.

Evaluating the performance of Self-Help Groups (SHGs), it tries to identify the factors that contribute to their successul performance and sustainability. It also studies the level of participation of women in SHGs and examines the group dynamics that influence their participation.

The banking contraction caused by Argentina's ""Tequila Crisis"" (brought on by the devaluation of the Mexican Peso), among other factors, has constrained access to financial services by small, rural producers. Schreiner (Center for Social Development, Washington U. in St. Louis) surveys these factors, describing the ways in which producers use financial services and looking at the current institutional forms of finance supply. He investigates mismatches in finance supply and demand and suggests improvements in the micro and macro structure of the market for long-term access to rural microfinance.

Case studies have highlighted its potential role in creating social capital and advancing human development. Women throughout the world contribute to the economic growth and sustainable livelihoods of their families and communities. In India, many of the microfinance programs target women - the most vulnerable segment of the society. This book investigates the relationship between microfinance and women in Rajasthan. Rajasthan, a predominately feudal society in India, is a relatively backward state with respect to microfinance movement. Low literacy rates among women, sparsely distributed population in hamlets in far-off villages, a well-established caste system - all these combine to give a very different flavor to the whole microfinance movement in Rajasthan. The book not only examines women empowerment and income earning opportunities, but management, livelihood skills, sustainability, and social acceptance of the whole movement.

In developing economies including India this is in vogue for quite some time. Its success is vindicated by the conferment of Noble Prize on the pioneer, Dr. Mohammad Yunus and has ignited serious thinking by academicians, researchers, practitioners and policy makers. Recent years have seen a plethora of research works on this subject its effectiveness, outreach, sustainability, impact, regulation etc. Most importantly the sustainability aspect is highly emphasised as the outreach has reached a sizeable number of households, particularly in India. This book precisely delves into the aspect of sustainability of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and of the most acclaimed programme of micro financing, i.e., SHGBank Linkage Programme (SBLP) launched by NABARD in early nineties. The primary data base for this work is from a most micro finance deserving states of North East India, i.e., Meghalaya where more than 80 percent of population lives in rural areas and more than onethird lives below poverty line. From a survey of credit linked SHGs sustainability variables of SHGs, its linked banks and of the SBLP have been identified and finally an index has been prepared to scale the sustainability of the programme as a whole. This type of work particularly on grassroots organisations like SHGs is very scanty. In North East this is the first of its kind which provides a detailed picture about the financial conditions of SHGs and their longterm prospects.

Bangladesh in the leader of collateral free microcredit model. More than 25 million poor people from over 50 countries of the world are benefiting from microcredit.. There was, however, a void in microcredit literature about its origin. Collateral free microcredit dates back to 1905 when Rabindranath Tagore founded kaligram Krishi Bank in Patishar in the district of Naogaon. This book traces the events leading to the establishment of kaligram Krishi Bank by poet Tagore who was the landlord of Patishar area.
The microfinance institutes (MFIs) of Bangladesh are unique in that they work as bankers to the poor but they are not banks. The MFIs are part of the Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) providing a variety of loan products to the poor people according to the missions of their parent NGOs.

With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope. They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS. Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women's potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it's also the best strategy for fighting poverty.

The doctrine of self-interest is re-examined by looking more closely at Adam Smith through the eyes of Amartya Sen.

Franklin intended that the money be used to provide loans to young married artisans to enable them to start small businesses and thereby promote a higher standard of living and a strong moral community. Although the managers put in charge of the endowment did not lend as effectively as Franklin had hoped, the loans did aid numerous small businessmen. Without fully realizing it, Franklin invented an idea that would come to fruition some two centuries later in the global microfinance movement.

This African country recently completed a thirty-year war of liberation and lives today through an extraordinary period of construction of its own national identity. Committed to promoting and supporting microcredit initiatives, it seeks an active participation by women in the process of reconstruction and remains a country firmly committed to its own history and culture. Eritrea therefore constitutes an excellent case for observing and analyzing microcredit programs on a large scale, carried out in a very geographically varied land, with a high number of participants and a diverse population, in a postwar situation.

They identify the strategies carried out by the various subjects involved, field agents and clients to further develop the possibilities of such programs.

This book builds a feminist social justice framework from practices of women's activism in India to understand and work to overcome these injustices. The feminist social justice framework provides an alternative to mainstream philosophical frameworks that promote global gender justice: for example, universal human rights, economic projects such as microfinance, and cosmopolitanism. McLaren demonstrates that these frameworks are bound by a commitment to individualism and an abstract sense of universalism that belies their root neo-liberalism. Arguing that these frameworks emphasize individualism over interdependence, similarity over diversity, and individual success over collective capacity, McLaren draws on the work of Rabindranath Tagore to develop the concept of relational cosmopolitanism. Relational cosmopolitanism prioritizes our connections while, crucially, acknowledging the reality of power differences. Extending Iris Young's theory of political responsibility, McLaren shows how Fair Trade connects to the economic solidarity movement. The Self-Employed Women's Association and MarketPlace India empower women through access to livelihoods as well as fostering leadership capabilities that allow them to challenge structural injustice through political and social activism. Their struggles to resist economic exploitation and gender oppression through collective action show the vital importance of challenging individualist approaches to achieving gender justice. The book is a rallying call for a shift in our thinking and practice towards re-imagining the possibilities for justice from a relational framework, from independence to interdependence, from identity to intersectionality, and from interest to socio-political imagination", , ,HT,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0, ,0,2019,    3.00,6

Although systemic flaws have become obvious, most strikingly with the 2010 Indian crisis that was marked by overindebtedness, suicides and violence, the industry's expansion continues unabated. As Philip Mader argues, microfinance heralds less the end of poverty than new, more financialized forms of poverty.

Despite their differences, Roy shows how both SFE and Janam are tied together with India's neoliberal economic restructuring.

An increasing acknowledgement that financial services hold the key to mainstreaming the poor and disadvantaged in India makes this detailed account of financial inclusion--both as a concept and as a veritable solution to aid in the country's development--a timely resource. The book states that the primary goal of financial inclusion is to broaden the scope of activities of the formal financial system, thus allowing people of low income to gradually participate in the system and thereby freeing the poor from poverty. The authors argue that important financial services such as credit, savings, insurance, and remittances should be provided at an affordable cost to low-income citizens. Topics discussed in the book include current financial exclusion; the roles of microfinance, banks, and nongovernmental organizations in financial inclusion; the Indian financial system; the credit needs of weaker sections of society in India; and Scheduled Castes development corporations.",1, ,RE,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2012,    1.00,1

The apparent success of the Grameen Bank (that is, recruitment of clients, investment of loans, recovery rates on invested loans and profit margins) has made microcredit a new model for poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Anthropological research results on Grameen Bank lending to women presented in this book, however, illuminates the link between the success of the bank and debt-cycling of borrowers. The priority of earning profits to insure institutional economic viability caused Bank employees at the grassroots level to emphasize increasing the number of loans disbursed and loan recovery. By using the joint liability model of lending, the Bank workers and borrowing peers impose intense pressure on clients for timely repayment. Many borrowers maintain their regular payment schedules, but do so through a process of loan recycling (that is, pay off previous loans with new ones) that considerably increases borrower debt liability. The debt burdens on individual households in turn increase tension and anxiety among household members and produce unintended consequences for many clients.This book examines women borrowers' involvement with the microcredit program of the Grameen Bank, and the grassroots lending structure of the bank; it illustrates the implications of Grameen lending for the borrowers, their household members and bank workers. The focus of the study is on the processes of village-level microcredit operation; it addresses the realities of the day-to-day lives of women borrowers and bank workers and explains informant strategies for involving themselves in this microcredit scheme.  The study is on the power dynamics of everyday lives of informants as they affect women borrowers' relationships within the household and the loan centers, and bank worker relationships within the loan center and the bank.",1, ,CS,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,1999,    3.00,7

In India, the advancement and empowerment of women has been a leading objective of state policy ever since the attainment of independence in 1947. Institutions of different types - central, state, and local governments; non-governmental organizations; civil society; and other bodies - are active to ensure gender equality as laid down in the Constitution of India. India's Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012) recognizes women for the first time not just as equal citizens, but as agents of economic and social growth. The Plan's approach to gender equity is based on the recognition that interventions in favor of women must be multi-pronged and that they must be provided with basic entitlements. Self-help Groups (SHGs) have emerged as an effective instrument to promote entrepreneurship and self-confidence among women, particularly in rural areas.

Credit Management for Poverty Alleviation centres on poverty endured by women in developing countries and how this can be alleviated. According to the United Nations Development Fund for Women, of the absolute poor today, over seventy per cent are women. Women earn only ten per cent of the world's income and own less than ten per cent of the world's property. This publication focuses on the need for smaller enterprises to more effectively reduce poverty and the hardships placed on women in developing countries and therefore help in the part-realisation of the millennium development goals.This publication is divided into two parts. The first half focuses on thematic perspectives and ideas, offering models of credit management for poverty alleviation and financial analysis of credit projects, their viability and suitability. The second half offers different perspectives from nineteen countries in Commonwealth Africa in order that they may provide valuable examples of poverty alleviation under very different circumstances.This publication discusses the justification and vital need for access to credit and effective credit schemes that are sustainable for the disadvantaged woman especially those in sparsely populated areas. This book should provide a long-standing knowledge and skills resource for trainers and policy makers as well as planners and strategists in the management of credit schemes for poverty alleviation. This is valuable information for entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, and the developing world in general.Published by SFI Publishing and distributed by the Commonwealth Secretariat.",1, ,M,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0, ,0,2005,    1.00,2

 The book money Microenterprises in Bhutan is based on empirical study. It investigates how microfinance system applies to Bhutan, assesses the problems and prospects of microenterprises and analyses the role of various agencies, particularly the financial institutions in meeting the vital needs of the mincroenterprises for finance. It is said that the major problem of the microenterprises is financial in nature.

Providing an overview of economic development and growth of microenterprises in Bhutan, the book confirms that microenterprises have started as early as human inhabitation and were rural based. In Bhutan they began in the form of Zoring chug Sum (thirteen arts and crafts), which were slacked in the face of development. Growth of microenterprises in Bhutan has begun only about two decades ago. The book reflects the importance and need of microenterprises in a developing economy like Bhutan, especially when it is moving from subsistence farming to modern economy. The book examines the role of money-lenders in lending to microenterprises, problems faced and their operating system in Bhutan.

The book delves into the problems of financial systems/intermediation and answers numerous questions in the subject basing its study on a basic hypothesis: Development of the financial system in Bhutan has resulted in proper and easier access to credit for microenterprises. Various other hypotheses related to his were advanced and statistically tested when required in the course of the study. The study lays a foundation in the study. The study lays a foundation in the subject to enable policy makers and future researchers to examine further the need of microenterprises and how to address their future growth and development.",1, ,CS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2004,    1.00,2

This book presents a rigorous empirical study of various aspects of poverty alleviation in rural Bangladesh. The themes include the trend and structure of rural poverty and the role of microfinance in alleviating rural poverty through participation of the rural poor in NGOs and microfinance institutions (MFIs). It also includes different challenges of participation of rural poor women in NGO-MFIs. In probing those issues, this book employs a different approach of investigation. In comparison with other poverty studies, this book can claim a number of distinct features. This book probes the participation behavior of rural poor women who face different socioeconomic, cultural and psycho-attitudinal challenges to participate in NGO-MFIs which ultimately prevented the attainment of the prime objective of poverty alleviation in Bangladesh. In analyzing those issues, this book uses a social psychological theory named the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as a theoretical model upon which the research framework was grounded upon. Unlike other studies which are based on relatively small and unrepresentative samples, this book is based on a nationally representative large-scale survey. Even though it employs a cross-sectional survey, the study explored in this book attempts to infuse an element of dynamics by employing information on both current and initial condition of resources of households being defined as the resource-base a household had inherited at the time it was formed. This type of data-set helped analyze the dynamics of resource adequacy of the participants in NGO-MFIs which yielded key insights into the challenges of poverty alleviation. A concern with the possible influence of microfinance in the economy runs as an intrinsic theme throughout the book. In addition to devoting a long chapter of emergence of NGO-MFIs in Bangladesh, the author analyzes the role of microfinance in its specific contexts in each subsequent chapter.",1, ,CS,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2019,    1.00,2

Despite the phenomenal increase in the physical outreach of formal credit institutions in the past several decades, the disadvantaged sections of society, including women, continue to depend on informal sources of credit. Regular institutions have faced difficulties in dealing with a large number of small borrowers, whose credit needs are small and frequent, and their ability to offer collateral is limited. Cumbersome procedures and risk perceptions of the banks leave a gap in serving the credit needs of the poor. It is in this context that micro credit has emerged as the most suitable and practical alternative to conventional banking in reaching India's poor population. Micro credit enables the poor, including women, to be thrifty and helps them by making available the credit and other financial services for improving their income and living standards. The Self-Help Group (SHG)-Bank Linkage Program was formally launched in 1992 and aptly supported by the RBI through its policy support. The Program envisages the organization of the rural poor into SHGs for building their capacities to manage their own finances and then negotiate bank credit on commercial terms.

Daniela Röttger's research demonstrates how MFIs can mitigate risks and costs of lending to smallholder farmers by using a combination of proven traditional microfinance mechanisms while adapting specific loan features and lending mechanisms to the particularities of smallholder agriculture. She systematically compares traditional microfinance risk management mechanisms with agricultural microfinance approaches and identifies successful strategies. Eight MFIs providing agricultural finance to smallholder farmers in four countries in East and West Africa (Uganda, Kenya, Benin, Cameroon) were interviewed and their loan features and agricultural lending mechanism were analyzed.

Beck focuses on two NCOs that use drastically different methods in working with poor rural women in Guatemala. She highlights how each program's beneficiaries-diverse groups of savvy women-exercise their agency by creatively appropriating, resisting, and reinterpreting the lessons of the NGOs to match their personal needs. Beck uses this dynamic-in which the goals of the developers and women do not often overlap-to theorize development projects as social interactions in which policymakers, workers, and beneficiaries critically shape what happens on the ground. This book displaces the notion that development projects are top-down northern interventions into a passive global south by offering a provocative account of how local conditions, ongoing interactions, and even fundamental tensions inherent in development work allow such projects to persist, but in new and unexpected ways.

Illustrated through the stories of visionary and innovative leaders in many fields, including Elon Musk (Tesla), Malala Yousafzai (human rights), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), and Muhammad Yunus (microfinance and development), this volume links an ancient Buddhist concept, known as the Noble Eightfold Path, to contemporary needs to develop an alternative paradigm to the excessive bottom-line focus and winner-take-all approach that has come to dominate leadership practice in recent decades. The stunning rejection by the United Kingdom of the European Union and the divisive US presidential race of 2016 serve as a dramatic backdrop to complex social issues--from international terrorism and domestic police brutality to debates over immigration, climate change, and free trade--that require creative solutions bringing together stakeholders from different fields and points of view. The Eightfold Path--characterized by the following elements: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration--is an approach to leadership that balances individual and collective concerns while aligning pragmatic and spiritual priorities.

It studies rural poverty, analyzing the trend in employment, the trickle-down process and the inclusiveness of growth in rural India. It also evaluates the impact of microfinance, as an instrument of financial inclusion, on the socio-economic conditions of rural households. Lastly, it examines the relative performance of fifteen major states of India in terms of education, health and human development.

After making hundreds of microloans online, Bob wanted to see the results first-hand, and in this book he travels from Peru and Bosnia to Rwanda and Cambodia, introducing us to some of the most inspiring and enterprising people we've ever met, while illuminating day-to-day life--political and emotional--in a world that Americans never see.--From publisher description", , ,RE,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1, ,0,2013,    3.00,7

There is an important if largely unremarked diversity within African Christianity; on the one hand, an enchanted Christianity that views the world as pervaded by spiritual forces, and on the other a disenchanted Christianity that discounts them. An enchanted Christian sees his glorious destiny threatened by witches, spirits, and ancestral curses. Churches catering for this worldview lay bare the workings of this spirit world, and this enchanted imagination, along with the prosperity gospel, and emphasis on the pastor's 'anointing', are the principal characteristics of much African Pentecostalism. Gifford argues that the enchanted religious imagination militates against development by encouraging fear and distrust, diminishing human responsibility and agency, and downplaying functional rationality. The prosperity gospel of 'covenant wealth from tithes and offerings' is the antithesis of Weber's Protestant ethic; and to magnify the person of the pastor is to perpetuate the curse of the 'Big Man'.Official Catholicism, totally disenchanted and long associated with schools and hospitals, is now involved in development, from microfinance to election monitoring, from conflict resolution to human rights. This 'NGO-ization of Catholicism', made almost inevitable by funding from secular donors like the EU and UN, even if defended theologically, comes at the price of failing to address the 'religious' needs of so many African Christians", , ,M,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0, ,0,2015,    3.00,6

Financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies. Alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents. In large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank. Meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service. Financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life. This means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand.

As HIV and AIDS simultaneously undermine livelihoods and household and community safety nets, families are especially vulnerable to poverty, food insecurity, and threats to their children’s nutrition, health, and education, with irreversible consequences. With more than 33.3 million people affected by HIV globally, a new focus on the risks for families and the long-term well-being of children has accelerated international, regional, and national commitments to social protection programs in heavily AIDS-affected countries. Cash transfers have demonstrated a strong potential for reducing poverty and strengthening children’s education, health, and nutrition. As a result, they can play a critical role in a strategy for mitigating the impact of AIDS and reducing poverty-related drivers of HIV transmission. Cash transfers have been used increasingly in social protection systems in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. More recently these programs have begun to target children and families affected by HIV and AIDS. The urgency of cash assistance for food purchases is underscored by emerging evidence that better nutrition can slow AIDS disease progression. In Social Protection and Cash Transfers to Strengthen Families Affected by HIV and AIDS, authors Michelle Adato and Lucy Bassett explain how cash transfer programs can make a difference for families affected by poverty and HIV and AIDS. The authors review the impacts of a range of cash transfer programs and discuss how these and other social protection programs can be designed to address the needs and conditions of families and children in regions hard hit by HIV and AIDS",1, ,M,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2012,    1.00,1

A widely documented problem in developing countries with undeveloped financial sectors is the mismatch between institutional savings and investment, resulting in a lack of investment in productive capital. It is a common fallacy that individuals in developing countries do not save. On the contrary, it has been found that even in the poorest rural areas saving is rife, albeit frequently this does occur in a non-monetized fashion. Savings are an important precautionary device in protecting against uncertainty. In order to encourage individuals to save, it is therefore vital that the savings be liquidated when needed to cope with an income shock. This requires well developed financial markets. Traditionally, it has been held that higher saving raises Gross Domestic Product by increasing capital accumulation especially when coupled with technological innovation. Developing countries such as Kenya need to reform their social security systems since that is an important route for mobilizing savings. Private savings are affected by the extent and coverage of government run social security systems in the sense that if individuals perceive that when they retire they are going to receive higher benefits from the government, they will tend to reduce the amount saved during their active days. Developing new institutions in the social security sector along the above lines could then force savings in low income countries with depressed levels of saving. This book has identified various factors that affect mobilization of savings from small and micro savers. It has brought to the fore the unique challenges faced by such savers as well as their providers. It makes specific recommendations which will be very useful for institutional and national development. It will also be helpful to business, economics and banking students of all levels. This book adds great value in the field of financial sector development. Issues discussed herein, though pertinent are by no means exhaustive. There are clearly a number of areas identified in this book that require further investigation.",1, ,CS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2009,    1.00,1

Deep and intertwined in our humanity, is a need to support and feel involvement in the kinds of projects and companies which we care about. Until the recent crowdfunding phenomena emerged, our more centralized and intermediated capital formation and funding mechanisms scarcely recognized the social power of crowds which form affinities around any kind of mission. Crowdfunding is a natural systemic response to fill this gap, and an expression of our collective human will. It is perhaps, one of the most powerful developments in our modern-day socio-economics, and promises both to transform the capital formation landscape and to offer an avenue for a creative and intellectual re-birth. Whether funding sports-car racers, startup companies, indie movies, fashion, scientific research, or community projects -- crowdfunding is already well under way, changing not only the way that we fund efforts, but the way we interact and support them. It is in the most simplistic terms, social networking meets venture financing. And a number of people in venture financing are now getting involved it.There are now nearly 7 billion of us, with over 2 billion having Internet access. Never before has there been such potential to bridge the collective creative and productive capacity with capital and other resources which are required to translate that capacity into social and economic activities. Even as exciting, is that crowdfunding links funding with the social dynamics and affinity groups which naturally surround efforts that resonate with our many motivations. That alone, is enough to cause a monumental shift in the way business and organizations operate.This is a deep and broad look at the history of finance that got us here, the present day zeitgeist of crowdfunding and its associated social networking & group dynamics, and a visionary look into the future and greater empowerment of crowdfunding.

Throughout the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the movement cultivated an image of being a champion of home ownership for the working classes, but housing historians have questioned whether building societies really lived up to this claim. This study fills a major gap in the historiography of the movement by investigating the class profile of building society members, and how the design of different building societies affected their accessibility, efficiency, and risk-taking practices between 1880 and 1939. These themes are explored using case studies of several building societies from this period and drawing upon extensive archival records.  The Building Society Promise shows that building societies did lend to working-class households before the First and Second World Wars, with some societies showing a greater commitment to working-class home ownership than others. What ultimately affected the outreach of individual societies was the quality of information they possessed, which in turn was largely determined by the types of agency networks they used to find and select borrowers. The phenomenal growth of some of these institutions in the inter-war period, however, and the ensuing competition which emerged between them, brought about profound changes in their firm structure which impaired their ability to reach out to lower-income households as efficiently as before. The findings of this research are relevant to both past and present debates about the optimal design of financial institutions in overcoming social exclusion in credit markets, and the deleterious effects that firm growth, market competition, and managerial self-interest can have on their performance and stability.",1, ,M,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2016,    2.00,5

It then examines the three primary energy subsystems of electricity, transportation, and thermal energy, explaining such relevant topics as systems thinking, cost estimation, capital formation, market design, and policy tools.

The detailed analysis of these particular areas of finance thus provides a means for investigating aspects of the important topic of private regulation and enforcement in financial markets. A number of pertinent questions are addressed, including: How does private regulation and enforcement enhance or detract from the legitimacy of the process by which these market segments are managed and controlled? How does private regulation and enforcement manifest independence of action and judgment, as compared with public regulation? How does private regulation and enforcement measure up along dimensions of quality, relative to public regulation? and, finally, What forms of accountability characterize private as opposed to public regulation and enforcement?

In India, micro finance is a movement with the underlying objective of helping poor households to have access to financial services, including credit at affordable cost. Many of those who promote micro finance believe that such access will help poor people get out of poverty. For others, micro finance is a way to promote economic development, employment, and growth through the support of micro entrepreneurs and small businesses. Women in India are typically poorer than men and have fewer options for earning a livelihood that provides adequate food, housing, and education for their children. However, they are also viewed as the change agents of the family. Women are more likely to invest their earnings into improving the lives of the families. By encouraging women to take charge of their futures, micro finance institutions can impact families and whole communities. However, the pace of women empowerment in India, through micro finance, is slow, due to a variety of constraints which urgently need to be rooted out. This book examines some of the issues that need to be addressed in order to empower the lives of India's women through micro finance.",1, ,CS,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0, ,0,2014,    1.00,2

Corruption: Economic Analysis and International Law by Marco Arnone and Leonardo Borlini reviews the richness and complexity of the ongoing research on corruption and shows the value of integrating a comprehensive economic understanding of its consequences and a critical assessment of the several legal instruments promoted by major intergovernmental organizations on this issue. This approach is particularly timely because, on the bright side, this book shows that economic crises may lead to greater social responsiveness in the face of attempts to drain public resources through corruption and bribery. The use of a wide range of economic models and the acute analysis of the contemporary evolution of traditional institutions belonging to the realm of international and European law represent two additional values of this work. Finally, the personal commitment of both authors to scientific research and professional activity related to public governance and anti-corruption reforms make this book a valuable source for further thought and analysis for scholars, public servants and practitioners.'--Giorgio Sacerdoti, Professor of International and European Law, Bocconi University and former Chairman of the WTO Appellate Body and Vice President of the OECD Working Group on Corruption. 'It is now rather common to speak of ""transnational law"" as an approach to legal research that transcends national frontiers and domestic regulatory policies. Such a model accepts that rules can be generated not just by governments or by international cooperation, but also by individuals, corporations and various other organizations. As clearly evidenced by this book, unfortunately, one of the most successful transnational systems is the one based on corruption. The authors however, never to be defeated, show through a rigorous legal and economic analysis how instead to develop policies and rules to fight what is sometimes perceived as an unavoidable phenomenon. In short, an invaluable addition to the study of this still largely unexplored area.'--Andrea Biondi, Kings College London, UK. 'In everyday understanding, corruption means degradation, decomposition, degeneracy, depravity. The concept is common to all cultures, and all dictionaries provide for very close descriptions. Corruption, in a specific connotation, is also defined by the statutory law of most - if not all - States as a criminal offense: it is an illicit trade of official functions, committed while betraying the very reason (""the duties"") of one's office. Corruption alters, dismantles and depraves the idea of a civil society, as it critically wounds the bond of trust that lays at its very basis, and, thus, the deepest foundation of all social relations. To marginalise corruption, and heal the damages it causes to society at large, it is necessary, first, to investigate what corruption is. By thoroughly analyzing the phenomenon per se, and offering a review of possible remedies against it, this book brilliantly and with exceptional efficacy, contributes to such an indispensable goal.'--Gherardo Colombo, formerly Public Prosecutor, Milan Public Prosecutor's Office and Judge, Supreme Court of Italy.

While effective macropolicies remain necessary for any successful development strategy, the need for complementary microstrategies at the grassroots level has become apparent. Among the various grassroots approaches, microcredit not only shows unique promise in alleviating poverty, but also offers the poor a better future through self-reliance.

Used in conjunction with an institutional appraisal of financial sustainability, governance, management, staff and systems, a poverty assessment allows for a more holistic understanding of an MFI.  The Tool provides accurate data on the poverty levels of MFI clients relative to people living in the same community.

Most of them look at failed policies and criticize what does not work. This text looks at what does work, and outlines how to implement these effective policies. The question of credibility and strategic behaviors in institutions of poverty reduction is an area that needs to be addressed adequately and the author attempts to deal with it in a pragmatic way.  In the academic literature on designating effective institutions of poverty alleviation programs and policies in sub-Saharan Africa, it is rare to find direct assessments of the success of particular social policies and programs. In country after country, one is much more likely to see research on the failure of poverty reduction programs. Very often, contributors to the literature gravitate towards the presentation of raw numbers and figurers indicating that these policies and programs have failed and thus call for the discontinuation of such policies. Curiously, the most straightforward questions that many people outside of the development circle seem to want answered – such as, on what criteria are these conclusions reached, or what particular policies and programs have made a dent in poverty, are less popular in the discipline. This study focuses on the preconditions for success in poverty reduction programs. It proposes a framework which incorporates a mixture of social and political, as well as economic relationships, which these programs embody. Using evidence from original surveys of two micro-finance programs in Southern Nigeria, this policy evaluation study attempts from the standpoint of institutional and social capital theories to accomplish two goals: first, to fill the gaps in the literature by developing an evaluation framework emphasizing institutional design features and a strong network of relationships which lower costs for beneficiaries and providers; and second, to provide critical input for the policy task of designing effective institutions of poverty reduction programs.",1, ,CS,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2013,    4.00,9

As part of a diversified financial system, a well-developed domestic bond market can help provide the long-term financing needed for sustainable growth. It can also produce broad-ranging benefits throughout the economy. In South Asia the development of domestic debt securities markets lags. The markets remain small compared both with the size of the region's economies and with markets in East Asia. Even in India the market is still small relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), suggesting that long-term debt financing remains at an early stage in the region. Equity markets and banks still dominate South Asian financial systems. Measures are needed to enhance both the depth and the breadth of South Asian bond markets, to bring them into line with those in East Asia and, in the long run, with those in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. This study assesses domestic debt securities markets in South Asia, identifies constraints to their development, and recommends measures for developing deeper, broader, and more efficient markets that can provide a competitive source of finance across a wide range of maturities for different debt issuers. The study covers five countries-Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Within the region the development of domestic debt securities markets varies widely. India's is the most developed.

In Bootstrap Dreams, Nancy C. Jurik analyzes the origins and maturation of these programs in the United States.

Half of Pakistani adults, mostly women, do not engage with the financial system at all, and only 14 percent have access to formal services. Credit for small- and medium-size enterprises is rationed by the financial system. The formal microfinance sector reaches less than 2 percent of the poor, as opposed to more than 25 percent in neighboring countries. Yet it is the micro- and small businesses, along with remittances, that help families escape the poverty trap and participate in the economy.  'Bringing Finance to Pakistan’s Poor' is based on a pioneering and comprehensive survey and dataset that measures the access to financial products by Pakistani households. The survey included 10,305 households in all areas of the country, excluding the tribal regions. The accompanying CD contains summary statistics.  The authors develop a picture of access to and usage of financial services across the country and across different population groups, and they identify policy and regulatory priorities. Reform measures in Pakistan have been timely, but alone are not enough; financial institutions have lagged behind in adopting technology, segmenting customer bases, diversifying products, and simplifying processes and procedures. Gender bias and low levels of financial literacy remain barriers, as is geographical remoteness. However, the single strongest cause of low financial access is lack of income―not location, education, or even gender.

Fully updated in January 2016, and detailing the changes going live on May 16 2016, this is the definitive book on equity crowdfunding for startups i.e. selling shares in your company over the Internet. The process started several years ago with Title III of the JOBS Act and has morphed over time to the final rules on Regulation Crowdfunding from the SEC. This book, updated several times over the last few years, was the very first book on Equity Crowdfunding in the USA and was the #1 book on Amazon in its category for over a year. Raising venture capital has become easier, with the passage of the JOBS Act. It’s new, it’s different, and it’s big! Selling shares in your startup through crowdFunding is a big deal. It’s going to totally change the whole way venture capital is raised. This book is for entrepreneurs and business owners to quickly understand what they need to know and where to find it. It’s more than collecting the cash; you need to set up a real company with real customers and real cash flow. And sell shares in it. This book covers what you need to do to make crowdfunding your startup a success, in a concise and clear way. The book has 5 sections: 1. How Crowdfunding Works for Startups. After a quick explanation of how crowdfunding came to be, the book looks at how crowdfunding fits into the field of venture capital. Then it addresses how Regulation Crowdfunding has changed things, with a detailed commentary on the 12 most important changes. The chapter ends with suggestions for where crowdfunding would be best used, and perhaps not so well suited. 2. Setting up a Company Worth Funding. You have to get the dogs to eat the dog food (i.e. will customers buy?), and you have to do it better than the competition. Investors expect you to make money. You can’t wait forever; you have to lift off quickly. And you need to get the boring stuff, like legal documents and company status, right. 3. Raising the cash. Making the company attractive to investors - means understanding how crowdfunding works for them. Then readers are taken through the critical part of putting a value on the company and pricing its shares. Get this wrong and you will work for years for nothing, or you won’t get funded. Then you have to build trust, reach investors and collect the money! 4. You have the cash – now what? Well, now you have the money, you have to perform and build all that value your promised! You are going to have to spend a lot of time talking to investors. Since few companies raise all they need the first round, you have to spend time looking for investors for the second round. And then, critically, for your investors, you will have to reach the liquidity event, when investors can cash out. 5. The Future of Crowdfunding for StartUps. It could all go horribly wrong (but we don’t think so) and you need to be ready to answer criticisms. Here the book helps you figure out what to say. The book then speculates on the possible bright future for crowdfunding for startups. It is all so new that many possibilities are opening up. It makes sense to see them before others do. Rupert Hart is uniquely positioned to write this book, with experience in venture finance and running, startups. He worked with Hermann Hauser, founder of ARM, the company that designs the chips for the iPhone. He worked with IDEO on new ventures. He helped set up E*TRADE UK. He has run several startups. He is the author of “Recession Storming: Thriving in Downturns through Superior Marketing, Pricing and Product Strategies” which was #1 in books to do with “Recession” on Amazon.com for 3 years. He has appeared in the International Herald Tribune and BBC TV’s Business Breakfast. He holds an MBA from INSEAD, one of the world’s top business schools. This is the book to buy!

The book also presents an evaluation of several policy interventions launched recently in mitigating seasonality, which provide a test case of what works and what does not in combating seasonal hunger. The major findings of the book are the following: (a) Policies to improve food security should explicitly take into account the seasonal dimension of food deprivation. (b) Gains from initiatives to combat seasonal hunger should be monitored and consolidated to ensure sustainable impacts. (c) Policies should also focus on areas that, owing to environmental degradation and climate change, are increasingly vulnerable to seasonal hunger and food insecurity in general.",1, ,M,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2012,    3.00,8

This book provides a thorough overview of the financing behind the audiovisual industry, including television, cinema and web. This book is open access under a CC BY licence. Recent reductions in public funding for audiovisual products have led to dramatic changes in the industry. The lack of interaction between the industry and capital markets has made sourcing funds for audiovisual products especially difficult. This book explains why the distance between the audiovisual and financial markets exists, and considers the perspective of both audiovisual companies and financial intermediaries. Providing a thorough overview of the audiovisual industry in three major categories (television, cinema and web), it analyses the financing behind each. The author adapts the traditional assessment methods to include exploitation rights, distribution deals and risk determinants; he also proposes a pricing model for the audiovisual products demonstrating that prices and values in a industry of prototype goods do not depend solely on cost and revenue. The book also includes a methodology for analysing the economics of the sector, the different sales agreements between broadcasters and the distribution deals between distributors and independent producers. Finally, a description of the main financial products for private finance is provided, as well as an explanation of how public funds can act as leverage to catalyze private resources through the use of guarantee funds. In The Economics of the Audiovisual Industry the author suggests that rather than relying on subsidized public support, the audiovisual industry should foster private-public partnerships and market dynamics to promote an alternative funding model based on a profitable and long-lasting connection between the audiovisual and financial markets.

This book started with a vision to portray Sudanese rural livelihood and question whether microfinance is able to sustain rural living. The village of Al Dagag, in the North Kordofan state of Sudan, was chosen to be the research case study. However, further questions arose due to using the inductive methodology of Grounded Theory. Throughout the entire research process, different categories emerged from the data, which conceptualize the perspective of the rural people on livelihood, microfinance, and financial institutions.

The book explores the problem of credit market segmentation, a widespread phenomenon in developing countries, within a theoretical framework based on graphical analysis. It investigates the causes and effects of this problem, and the impact of possible solutions. Credit market segmentation is an outgrowth of information-related problems and high transaction costs in lending. It leads to segmentation in labour markets and also results in inefficient factor allocation and highly skewed income distribution patterns. A theoretical impact analysis shows that microcredit programmes can eliminate the causes and effects of credit market segmentation and that their impact is much broader than is usually assumed.

However, historically, eclectic ideas and approaches often clash with existing long-established notions of progress and modes of realizing social and economic change. Managing Development in a Globalized World: Concepts, Processes, Institutions explores this topic by incorporating ideas and interpretations that have previously been neglected or given inadequate attention in the discourse on developing countries. It underscores development as a continuous process that must be supported by sound policies and efficient management, supplying a wider understanding of the field.  The authors argue that the application of innovative development techniques and best practices is essential for obtaining optimum results in meeting the needs of society. They examine the style of managing development with a new perspective that links the phenomenon with changing demands and the interplay of internal/external actors and a host of stakeholders. An exploration of key sectors in development provides clear comprehension of problems and solutions.

One key feature of global trade over this period has been the growing importance of not only product standards but, importantly, labor, environmental, food safety and social standards. Being essentially a non-tariff barrier, standards have often become critical to market access and essential to sustained competitiveness. This has a clear impact on the manner in which both global and Indian business is conducted now and in the future. It also underlines the need for a new area of enquiry that addresses the following questions: How are the Indian public and private actors - the state, domestic firms, local consumers and society - influencing and being influenced by such standards? Do standards really matter in an overwhelmingly informal production sphere, with consumers deeply segmented on the basis of a highly skewed distribution of income and with the rural population becoming further marginalized? We have limited knowledge about the challenges faced and strategies pursued by these key domestic actors, both public and private. How have they been able to drive these processes and what are their implications for larger concerns with inequalities and the conditions of the poor?

The Business of Doing Good reveals six insights for microfinance and other social purpose organizations using the marketplace to tackle a range of pressing social challenges. To deliver on good intentions, we need to do more than simply deliver 'good products', and become organizations designed to do good. The insights focus on creating a business model that moves beyond conventional wisdom about clients and marketplace. This means getting to grips with the realities of clients' lives, and delivering products that address their real needs (rather than simply chasing market demand). It also means recognizing that our vision is realized through our people. By tapping into their potential, and supporting them to do difficult work, we can do quality work -- and innovate to constantly do it better. Finally, the insights challenge us to make our social value proposition work from a business perspective -- defining our own trade-offs, and evolving our approach to respond to a fast-changing world.-- Provided by Publisher", , ,M,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, ,0,2015,    2.00,3

This book offers a comprehensive comparative analysis of the most significant models of microcredit guarantee funds adopted in three South European countries (Italy, France, Spain) and in three North African countries (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt). It provides a clear picture of microcredit guarantee funds in each country, focusing on three keys areas: analysis of the regulatory framework, mapping of microcredit institutions and analysis of the main features of guarantee funds. The authors highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the microcredit guarantee system and provide regulatory or operative solutions which may improve the economic sustainability of microcredit institutions and, ultimately, contribute to facilitating access to credit for microenterprises and the microborrower. The book will be a valuable resource for supervisors, microcredit institutions, guarantee intermediaries and financial intermediaries""-- Provided by publisher", , ,RE,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0, ,0,2014,    2.00,4

Written in an engaging, jargon-free style and loaded with practical advice, it explores the pitfalls and potential of the burgeoning impact revolution - the increasingly widespread belief that business and financial leaders should weigh social value as well as financial value in all of their decisions, to create both a better business model and a better world. Cheerleaders have written a number of books advocating the magic of impact finance. Greed Gone Good hopes for the magic too; but also believes that an uncritical eye does not effectively advance the cause. We now have ten years of impact investing history to examine, and not all of it is laudable. We could hold hands and sing Kumbaya in praise of impact finance; or we could employ constructive criticism to figure out what's gone well and what hasn't, and how we should move forward more productively. Greed Gone Good focuses on the roadmap - how to reorient and repackage finance and investing in order to deliver on this promise. In particular, it focuses on how to realize the potential of the impact revolution to become a silver bullet against future failures.

An opposing school of thought considers microcredit as a capitalist demon ensnaring the poor in poverty and debt. The layman and the million professionals working in this industry are at a loss to make sense of the stories that circulate about microcredit. This book provides this sense-making, useful for students, professionals, investors and researchers who are attracted to this field. Poverty is a wicked problem, akin to Hydra, the Greek mythological monster with many heads. As microcredit tries to balance multiple objectives to grapple with these multiple heads, it has needed to shift the weapons it uses. The arsenal for this battle has needed new philosophies, changing ethics, differing missions, institutional partnerships, the latest technologies and new products. These rapid innovations have differed in speed across the world, with adaptations in developed and developing countries. This book presents these with many case studies and field research. It is clear that development initiatives, no matter how financial, cross academic disciplines. At the very least, they affect disciplines such as economics, business management, sociology, history, geography, politics, legal systems in place, as well as science, which is evolving at such a high speed.

This book deals with the effectiveness and the capability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) to enhance womens livelihoods and empowerment and to mitigate the effects of HIV and AIDS in Côte dIvoire. The results show that MFI credit causes positive and negative effects. MFI credit has improved incomes, the level of farm production and human and social capital. MFI credit has also enhanced womens decision-making power within households due to their new ability to contribute to the improvement of the household standard of living. Furthermore, womens empowerment regarding the demand for and the use of credit give them more opportunity to obtain MFI credit. Despite the positive effects of MFIs on womens income, this publication shows that loan repayment was not successful among some female borrowers due to the fact that the loan has not been used for investment purposes. For MFIs, the diversion of loans can endanger their functioning and sustainability and therefore their effectiveness in rural areas. Regarding HIV, this book highlights the diversity and the specificity of the way HIV-affected individuals are financially supported by credit institutions. Both the direct and indirect effects of HIV and AIDS on womens livelihood and MFIs are analysed.",1, ,E,1,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0, ,0,2010,    2.00,3

If there were a popularity contest among all the parables of Jesus, the Good Samaritan would probably win. Nobody is against the Good Samaritan because being against the Good Samaritan is like being against Mother Theresa or Oskar Schindler or the firefighters who ran into the World Trade Center. In that same popularity contest, the Shrewd Manager would probably finish last. The Shrewd Manager is lazy, deceitful, and double-crossing. Yet in this alluringly freakish parable, Jesus actually holds up the Shrewd Manager as an example, as he does with the Good Samaritan. This book is about learning to live the message of the Good Samaritan in the context of the globalized world of the twenty-first century. This means learning to love our global neighbor wisely by harnessing the resources at our disposal--our time, talents, opportunities, and money--on behalf of those who are victims of injustice, disease, violence, and poverty. The early disciples were pretty clueless about worldly resources such as time, talent, and money--and unfortunately today we still don't really get it. There are too many kind, well-intentioned twenty-first-century people with indisputably good intentions but whose impact on the needy is hampered by their inability to diagnose problems properly, harness the resources available to them to solve the right problems, and understand cause-and-effect relationships. Shrewd Samaritan will help develop a framework to better love and care for our neighbors in an age of globalization, when the people in our neighborhoods, or at least those in our potential sphere of influence, has expanded dramatically.

Microfinance is a successful financial innovation to help the poor to sort out credit exclusion, which is one of the poverty traps that prevent billions of underserved, especially women, from escaping atavistic misery. Interconnected poverty traps range from misuse of natural resources (from blood diamonds to the oil curse) to conflict traps, demographic booming, being landlocked with bad neighbors or exposed to unfreedom. Other traps concern cultural backwardness, unsafe drinking and sanitation, food shortage up to starvation, illnesses or climatic shocks, causing mass migrations and unfair globalization. Microfinance, a grass-roots movement to provide credit to the neediest, can greatly help to dismantle at least some of these poverty traps, and thousands of mostly small institutions are competing in a market where demand from the poorest for financial services is potentially unlimited – while supply is not. While the success of microfinance, often ignited by foreign aid funding, has gone beyond any expectation, enormous problems are still on the ground. The road towards what is now considered microfinance’s optimal goal – maximization of outreach to the poorest, combined with financial self-sustainability – is still full of obstacles. Prof. Moro Visconti's book, covering a vacuum in the existing literature, considers state-of-the-art microfinance within a broader framework of sustainable and long-term socio-economic development. With an innovative and reader friendly approach, Moro Visconti introduces the reader to the multidimensional causes of poverty and possible remedies. A cultural approach to the poverty traps, mixing its anthropological causes with possible bottom-up remedies, including microfinance, emerges as a stunning innovation. The book aims at a broad readership from practitioners to students and academics, as well as readers simply interested in solutions to the world-wide poverty problems.",1, ,RE,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0, ,0,2011,    1.00,1

 Microfinance and Poverty Reduction: The Experierence of Ghana is the first book to provide a comprehensive overview of how microfinance is being used as a strategic tool by governments and other stakeholders to reduce the incidence of poverty in Ghana. It examines the unsuccessful and non-sustainable ways of providing credit to the poor by government under the old paradigm and compares that to the new paradigm where credit and other financial and non-financial services have been provided to the poor on a financially sustainable basis. The two case studies on the effect of participation in a microfinance programme and the depth of outreach of the programme attest to this to the fact. Offering guidance to pratitioners and policy makers on how to support the poor with small loans savings and insurance products etc to improve on their livelihoods, this is a book that sets th standard, both in terms of theory and practice, for future work in the field of microfinance and poverty reduction in Ghana and other developing countries.
